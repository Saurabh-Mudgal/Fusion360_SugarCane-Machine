# Fusion360 - SugarCane Machine
\
\
___3D model created following machine element design calculation for an original Sugar Cane Juicing Machine.___
\
\
Fusion 360 Inventor was used for solid modelling. Formal [report](https://github.com/Saurabh-Mudgal/Fusion360_SugarCane-Machine/blob/master/SugarCane%20Machine%20(Report).docx) contains documentation of all the calculation work. \
Project was made for course MA3001 under School of Mechanical &amp; Aerospace Engineering - Nanyang Technological University.\
